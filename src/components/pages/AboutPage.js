      <p className="p">In the fall of 2019, I took a leap. I decided to change careers, from banker to developer. I had been learning and doing front end development, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, on the side for quite some time and I felt like this was the thing I wanted to do. I still do(phew). So, what made me take this leap? Did I not like my job? Was I not getting along with my employer? Was I fired?? Actually. I was happy in my role, had a great relationship with management and I was thriving. But something was missing. </p>

      <h3 className="sub-heading">Why Front-End?</h3>
      <p className="p">I felt a strong urge to get into a business where I could fuel my creativity, where I would be able to constantly develop and where I would get a toolkit to show for, a toolkit that was customizable and not bound to one sector. Front-End Development fitted that description pretty darn well.</p>
      <p className="p">Do I get frustrated at times? Do I sometimes question my choice, the leap? Of course, who wouldn’t after three hours down trying to solve a bug that turns out being a spelling mistake in the entry path in your webpack configuration file. But in the end, when the problem is solved, especially a problem that seemed near impossible, it’s all worth it. </p>
      <p className="p">A big part of the charm with development, for me, is dealing with contrasting feelings, going from feeling like the dumbest person on the planet one day to a genius the next. </p>
      <h3 className="sub-heading">What I Bring to the Table</h3>
      <p className="p">I spent 12 years on customer focus work related tasks, for years of those in banking. The last three years has been in a Nordic(sub-international) organization, with a daily contact with people all over the place. This environment has greatly impacted my ability to communicate in a clear way and freely do so in both Swedish and English, but most important communicate with people of various backgrounds, ages and positions; sales people, retail bankers, developers, customer supporters, investment bankers and much more. </p>
      <p className="p">This skill, understanding others and what perspective they come from, together with a pretty good problem-solving skill, a willingness to learn and contribute, and a goal to always stay humble, is what I bring to the table. </p>
