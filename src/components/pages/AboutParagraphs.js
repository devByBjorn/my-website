// BACKSTORY
const backstoryOne = "In the fall of 2019, I took a leap. I decided to change careers from banker to developer. By this time, I had already been learning and doing front end on the side for quite some time and I felt like this really was the thing I wanted to do. I still do, thank god. "

const backstoryTwo = "Why this change? What made me take this leap? Did I not like my job? Was I not getting along with my employer? Was I fired!!? Actually. I was happy in my role, had a great relationship with management and I was thriving. But something was missing."

// WHY FRONT-END
const whyFrontEndOne = "I was looking for a field where I could fuel my creativity and be able to constantly develop - a field that wasn’t necessarily bound to one sector. Front-End Development fitted that description pretty darn well."

const whyFrontEndTwo = "I would lie if I said I never questioned my choice, the leap. After three hours down trying to solve a bug that turns out being a spelling mistake in the entry path in the webpack config file, or when I deployed this page and realized I've styled the whole page width 175% zoom in the browser, of course I can questione my choice. But in the end, when a problem is solved, especially a problem that seemed near impossible, it’s all worth it."

const whyFrontEndThree = "A big part of the charm with development, for me, is dealing with contrasting feelings, going from feeling like the dumbest person on the planet one day to a genius the next."

// WHAT I BRING TO THE TABLE
const whatIBringOne = "I've been working on customer focus-, business- and sales driven related tasks for about 10 years. Four years of those in banking. The last three years was in a Nordic(sub-international) organization. An organization where I had daily contact and collaboration with people from all over the bank. "

const whatIBringTwo = "This environment had a great impact on my ability to communicate in a free and clear manner, with people of various backgrounds, ages and positions. From markets salespeople, retail bankers, private bankers, investment bankers to IT maintenance, developers and customer supporters, and many more. To communicate well I needed to understand others and what perspective they came from. An understanding I hold high today"

const whatIBringThree = "The above skills, communication and seeing things from others perspective, together with a pretty good problem-solving skill, a willingness to learn and contribute, and a goal to always stay humble, is what I bring to the table."
