// BACKSTORY
const backstoryOne = "In the fall of 2019, I took a leap. I decided to change careers from banker to developer. By this time, I had been learning and doing front end on the side for quite some time and I felt like this really was the thing I wanted to do. And I still do(phew). "
const backstoryTwo = "You might wonder, why? What made me take this leap? Did I not like my job? Was I not getting along with my employer? Was I fired!!? Actually. I was happy in my role, had a great relationship with management and I was thriving. But something was missing."

// WHY FRONT-END
const whyFrontEndOne = "I was looking for a field where I could fuel my creativity, where I would be able to constantly develop, and a field that necessarily wasn’t bound to one sector Front-End Development fitted that description pretty darn well."

const whyFrontEndTwo = "I would lie if I said I never questioned my choice, the leap. Who wouldn’t after three hours down trying to solve a bug that turns out being a spelling mistake in the entry path in your webpack configuration file. But in the end, when a problem is solved, especially a problem that seemed near impossible, it’s all worth it."

const whyFrontEndThree = "A big part of the charm with development, for me, is dealing with contrasting feelings, going from feeling like the dumbest person on the planet one day to a genius the next."

const whatIBringOne = ["I spent about 10 years on customer focus, business and sales driven work related tasks, four years of those in banking. The last three years was in a Nordic(sub-international) organization. An organization where I hade daily contact and collaboration with people from all over the bank. "]

const whatIBringTwo = ["This environment hade a great impact on my ability to communicate in a free and clear way in both Swedish and English, but most important communicate with people of various backgrounds, ages and positions; sales people, retail bankers, developers, customer supporters, investment bankers and much more."]

const whatIBringThree = ["This skill, understanding others and what perspective they come from, together with a pretty good problem-solving skill, a willingness to learn and contribute, and a goal to always stay humble, is what I bring to the table."]
